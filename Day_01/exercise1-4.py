# Write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b.
#
# Warning. Do not change the code on lines 1-4 and 12-18. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any value of a and b.
c=input('input a ')
d=input('input b ')
a=d
b=c
print('a is ', a)
print('b is ', b)
